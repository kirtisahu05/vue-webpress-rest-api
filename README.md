# From Author - kirti kumar sahu
- use nuxt as vue framework for better and standardized app. plus easy to use and many more benifits.
- used vuetify as MD component framework, as it is more of vue specific and i have used element-ui and vuetify so thought vuetify as a best fit here.
- Implemented the requirement as per document.
- could have done better on look-n-feel side, i have only refered truecaller blog only.
- used api directly on client side, due to time constraints. Was facing issue with post, which was exected. i have implemeted it using stub data.
- Incase any changes or addon functionality implementation is needed feel free to let me know. ill make it :).
- thanks
